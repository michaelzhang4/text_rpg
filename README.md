# Terminal text-based RPG

A game I created to help me learn C++

## Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michaelzhang4/textrpg.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd textrpg

# Run make command
make
```

# Notes

Make sure to enable UTF-8 fonts in terminal otherwise the emojis won't load.

I found these commands work for me in windows CMD/Powershell to enable UTF-8 support for a terminal session:

POWERSHELL:
```sh
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
```
CMD:
```sh
chcp 65001
```
